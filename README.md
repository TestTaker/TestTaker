## TODOS ##
- Put footers inside main content area so that they are responsive
- add tooltips for all buttons
- make dialog for different items
- figure out layout + design
- improve frontend js organization

## MILESTONES ##
- Version 1.0 - This is where we are now. We have a basic setup with a backend Node.js API, Mustache for rendering, and Firebase for a database
- Version 2.0 - use front-end frameworks like Angular so we aren't rendering so much on the server (e.g. no more mustache)
- Version 3.0 - flash cards

## To think about ##
- Use a different database like mongodb to have more customization and control
