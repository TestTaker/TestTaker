TestTaker is a testing application.
## TODOS ##
- Put footers inside main content area so that they are responsive
- Change all links to correct endpoints for production

## MILESTONES ##
- Version 0.0.0 - this is where we are now
- Version 1.0 - we're working hard just to get this working with the backend Node.js API and Mustache for rendering
- Version 2.0 - use front-end frameworks like Angular so we aren't rendering so much on the server (e.g. no more mustache)
- Version 3.0 - flash cards
